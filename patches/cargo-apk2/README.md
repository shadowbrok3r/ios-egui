Tool for creating Android packages from native Rust crates. We have created this tool because the predecessor of this tool ([`cargo-apk`]) has stagnated for over a year at the time of writing this documentation.

This tool requires minimal setup and tooling, without the requirement of Gradle configuration. Ideal for apps that provide a [`NativeActivity`] via [`android-activity`] and [`ndk`].

In addition to features available in `cargo-apk`, this tool supports compiling sources of JVM-based languages into DEX data to be packaged in the APK file; declaration of multiple activities and even services are supported.

[`cargo-apk`]: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-apk
[`NativeActivity`]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NativeActivity
[`android-activity`]: https://crates.io/crates/android-activity
[`ndk`]: https://crates.io/crates/ndk

## Installation

From crates.io:

```shell
cargo install cargo-apk2
```

From locally downloaded or cloned source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mzdk100/cargo-apk2
cargo install --path cargo-apk2/
```

## Crate configuration

Android and thus `cargo-apk` require the [Cargo Target] to be a Shared Library, corresponding to Rust's `cdylib` `crate-type`.  For the sole library in a crate, configure this as follows in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[lib]
# Optionally supports a different library location using `path = "..."`
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

The source repository of this tool provides some example configurations.

[Cargo Target]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html

## Commands

- `build`: Compile the selected crate and package it into an APK
- `run`: Compile, install and run the selected crate/package on an attached Android device via `adb`
- `gdb`: Start a gdb session on an attached Android device via `adb`, with symbols loaded

## Examples

This repository includes various example projects demonstrating different features of `cargo-apk2`:

- `egui-examples/` - Examples using egui framework
- `groovy-examples/` - Examples with Groovy integration
- `java-examples/` - Examples with Java integration
- `kotlin-examples/` - Examples with Kotlin integration
- `ndk-examples/` - Examples using Android NDK
- `scala-examples/` - Examples with Scala integration

To run any example, navigate to its directory and execute:

```shell
cd egui-examples
cargo apk2 run
```

Make sure you have an Android device connected via `adb` and have installed `cargo-apk2` before running the examples.

## Manifest

`cargo apk` reads additional configuration from Cargo's `[package.metadata]` table. The following configuration options are supported by `cargo apk` under `[package.metadata.android]`:

```toml
[package.metadata.android]
# Use `aapt2` instead of `aapt` for compiling application resources.

#                              specially.
#
# `strip`                    - Debug symbols are stripped from the shared
#                              libraries before being copied into the APK.
#
# `split`                    - Functions the same as `strip`, except the debug
#                              symbols are written to the apk output directory
#                              alongside the stripped shared libraries, with
#                              a `.dwarf` extension.
#

# the application, is created when it's needed and the service runs in that process.
