//! `backdrop-blur-egui` — the egui adapter for frosted glass (grab-pass path).
//!
//! - **`grab-pass`** (the mainstream path: `eframe`-on-glow and the `cage` Wayland kiosk). The host
//!   owns the GL loop; `GrabPassRenderer` rides an egui **paint callback** that grabs the live
//!   framebuffer behind a surface, blurs it, and composites the frosted surface back. Build it once
//!   from `eframe::CreationContext::gl`, call `.frost(ui, surface)` per frame, and `.destroy(gl)` in
//!   `eframe::App::on_exit`. Pulls glow, never wgpu.
//!
//! The backend itself is the separate `backdrop-blur-glow` crate.
//!
//! The crate owns only a surface's *background*. The surface's content, foreground, and
//! accessibility stay the host's: a frosted [`Surface`] is a post-render composite, never an egui
//! widget, so it adds nothing to the AccessKit tree.
//!
//! # The three dials: blur, tint, presence
//!
//! A frosted [`Surface`] mixes three **independent** knobs — conflating them is the most common
//! "my glass looks wrong":
//!
//! - **[`BlurRadius`]** — in logical points; `0` = no blur (a plain tinted pane).
//! - **[`Tint`]** — the glass *film* painted over the blur, a linear-light color whose **alpha is
//!   the film mix** (how much tint shows vs. how much blurred backdrop shows through). A *colored*
//!   tint composites in color, not black — author it as sRGB with [`Tint::from_srgb_unmultiplied`]
//!   so the linear decode is done for you. Alpha `0` = pure blur, no film; alpha `1` = the film is
//!   opaque and the blur is invisible under it.
//! - **[`Presence`]** — the surface-global fade weight in `[0, 1]`: whether the glass is there at
//!   all, the whole frosted result blended over the destination. Drive it per frame to dissolve
//!   glass in/out. Default `1.0`.
//!
//! Rule of thumb: blur sets the *texture*, tint-alpha sets the *material*, presence sets
//! *whether it's there at all*. A barely-tinted heavy blur is clear vibrancy; a high tint-alpha is
//! frosted/opaque glass; presence below `1` fades the entire thing.
//!
//! # Grab-pass contracts (read before calling `frost`)
//!
//! The grab-pass path samples the **live framebuffer** mid-frame, which makes draw order and fade
//! load-bearing in ways the types cannot enforce:
//!
//! 1. **Enqueue the frost *before* the surface's foreground.** The callback grabs whatever is in the
//!    framebuffer at its position — content drawn *before* it. Call `frost(ui, surface)` first, then
//!    paint the surface's own content (text, controls) **after**, so the foreground lands on top of
//!    the blur. Enqueue it too late and it grabs — and blurs away — your own content. There is no
//!    runtime guard for this; it is a hard ordering contract.
//! 2. **Fade with [`Presence`], not `multiply_opacity`.** egui's `multiply_opacity` style multiplier
//!    **does not reach paint callbacks** — the standard fade silently no-ops on the blur. To
//!    dissolve frost in/out, drive the surface's `presence` field ([`Presence`]) per frame instead.
//!    This is the one egui trap that bites everyone; the [`Presence`] dial is the supported
//!    escape hatch.
//! 3. **A dynamically-sized rect needs *last frame's* rect.** In immediate mode the surface's rect
//!    is only known *after* its content lays out, but the frost must be enqueued *before* the content
//!    paints (contract 1) — a chicken-and-egg. The worked pattern: stash the rect in egui temp memory
//!    keyed by an `Id`, frost **last frame's** rect at the top of this frame, then lay out the content
//!    and write back the rect for next frame. It is stable while the surface is open; the only
//!    artifact is one frame of staleness on a resize. (A first-class reserved-slot API that returns
//!    the callback `Shape` for `painter.set()` is planned; until then this is the recommendation.)
//! 4. **Poll `GrabPassRenderer::take_frost_outcome` once per frame, after paint.** egui skips a
//!    fully-clipped callback, so a frosted surface is not guaranteed to paint; the typed
//!    `FrostOutcome` report distinguishes never-fired (`DidNotFire`, the wiring/version-skew
//!    check) from clipped-to-nothing, failed, and actually-composited. It is read-and-clear and
//!    ratchets to the *strongest* outcome between takes — so take it every frame, and read
//!    `Failed` from the throttled `log::warn!`, not from this value, when a same-frame composite
//!    could mask it (the doc on `FrostOutcome` spells out the masking asymmetry).
